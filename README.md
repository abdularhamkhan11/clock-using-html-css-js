Analog Clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project is a simple yet elegant analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually represents real-time updates of the current hour, minute, and second, making it a great example of how JavaScript can manipulate the DOM dynamically.

Features
✔️ Real-Time Display – The clock updates every second to show the current time.
✔️ Smooth Animations – The second, minute, and hour hands rotate smoothly for a realistic clock experience.
✔️ CSS Styling – The design is fully customizable with CSS, allowing different themes and styles.
✔️ JavaScript Logic – Uses the Date object in JavaScript to fetch the current time dynamically.
✔️ Responsive Design – The clock works well on different screen sizes.

Technology Stack
🖥️ HTML – Provides the structure for the clock.
🎨 CSS – Styles the clock face, hands, and background for a clean look.
⚙️ JavaScript – Handles the movement of clock hands and updates the time dynamically.

How It Works
The HTML file contains a div structure for the clock face and hands.
CSS is used to style the clock, positioning the hands at the center.
JavaScript fetches the current time using new Date(), calculates the angles for each hand, and applies CSS transformations to rotate them accordingly.
Possible Enhancements
Digital Clock Display alongside the analog clock.
Custom Themes allowing users to change the clock’s appearance.
Sound Effects for ticking sounds on every second.
This project is great for learning JavaScript animations, CSS styling, and time-based DOM manipulations.
